   Ajqvue COVID-19 Tracking Database
   
   The Ajqvue COVID-19 tracking database is a SQLite file database containing
   the raw data from the Github COVID19Tracking project from the US and States
   daily CSV files. The only difference should be the removal of the 'hash'
   field.
   
   The database will be updated each day if possible to correlate to the current
   raw data from the COVID19Tracking project.
   
   The reason the database was created because it affords the use of the Ajqvue
   database GUI to give access to the summary data, conduct analysis, and plot
   via heat map and various standard charts the data. These are all features
   available in the Ajqvue GUI via a local desktop application.
   
   Included with the repository is a Query Bucket file containing example SQL
   Queries that can be used to demonstrate visual plotting of data. Share or
   donate queries that can be included with Query Bucket file.

Installation Notes for Ajqvue:

   Ajqvue is a stand alone application. To get started download and unzip
the release file to your local hard drive using a program such as WinZip, 7-Zip,
Tar or similar compression/decompression program. Extract the Ajqvue files
to the desired location on the hard disk. On a Windows system this may be any
location, but on a Unix or Linux system it will be in the home directory of
the user. If multiple users are to access the application then consult with
the system administrator of your workstation. The likely location will be in
the /usr/local or a public directory, which all users have access to for
application execution.
